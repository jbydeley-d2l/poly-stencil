# PolyStencil

This is a test project that demonstrates an issue with Stencil + the WebcomponentJS polyfill on Edge. 

## Installation

`npm i`

## Running the test

`npm start`

This will start the polymer server and open your default browser to the correct URL. Try it out on Edge and notice the issue with the `fetch import module failed` error.
